## Webpack
Everything is compiled into one single js file `main.js` by webpack. Everything hosted on `gh-pages` branch (under sub-directory `dist`) was automatically generated by webpack. 

To deploy a subfolder to github pages, here's two useful references:
1. [Deploying a subfolder to GitHub Pages](https://gist.github.com/cobyism/4730490)
2. [Why can't I push this up-to-date Git subtree?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13756055/why-cant-i-push-this-up-to-date-git-subtree)

Happy coding!
